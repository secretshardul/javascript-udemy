# 1. variables and constants
```js
let x=10 //variable
const y= 5 //constant
```

## A. naming 
1. use **camelCase**, avoid snake_case(not recommended)
2. Numbers:
```js
let count10 //legal
let 10count //illegal- shouldn't be in start
```
3. Special characters: $ and _(underscore) are allowed everywhere, including start. Others like @ not allowed.
4. uninitialized variables are allowed
```js
let uninit //legal
```

## B. operators
| operation | symbols |
| ---       | ---     |
|add        | +       |
|subtract   | -       |
|multiply   | *       |
|divide     | /       |
|remaider   | %       |
|power of   | **      |

## C. data types
1. numbers- integers, float
2. strings- '',"",``(3 styles)   
### special properties of **template literals/backticks**(`)
1. **expresion interpolation**: embed equations in strings. This is not possible with others.
```js
const total=10
const output = `output: ${total}` // output: 10
const output2 = `output: ${1+1}` // output: 2
```
2. **multiline strings**-
```js
let x = ` this is 

sparta`
```
