# 1. What is javascript
1. **dynamic, weakly typed**:
- no strict types like int, string.
- They're assumed at runtime
- data types can change

2. **Interpreted**:
- compiled on the fly, unlike C++
- code can change at runtime, eg. variable types can change from string to int

3. **Hosted language**- runs on different environments, eg. browser and nodejs. They have an inverse relation
- browser: can manipulate HTML/CSS but not access file system (sandboxed)
- nodejs: can't manipulate HTML/CSS but can access file system
